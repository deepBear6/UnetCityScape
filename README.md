## Using CityScape dataset with Unet
Implementing Unet paper for the CityScape dataset.

However the learning stops at one point, so that is a TODO :((

checkstats.ipynb - check the accuracies of the saved models

GetData.py - loads data from folders and augments them if needed

CityScape_Train.ipynb - the main notebook, contains examples of the "best" models efficiency.
